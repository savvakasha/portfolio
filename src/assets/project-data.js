        overview: 'Nimbus is a conceptual AI-powered digital self-control tool designed to help users regulate screen time through a dynamic, behavior-aware system. Designed as a ubiquitous, cloud-like companion that follows users across devices, Nimbus leverages AI to track digital and real-world engagement, providing personalized feedback. The tool employs a balance of rewards and physical interventions to encourage mindful technology use. By tracking user behaviors, rewarding positive habits, and encouraging real-world engagement, Nimbus provides a personalized approach to mindful technology use. The research underscored the potential of AI in digital well-being while highlighting design considerations for future development.',
        designAndProcess: `Literature Review: Examined technology overuse, existing digital self-control tools, AI applications, and co-design as a research method.
User Interviews: Explored how and why users self-regulate their digital device usage, their experiences with current tools, and expectations for AI-driven interventions.
AI-Driven Insights: Identified key areas where AI could enhance self-regulation, such as detecting device usage patterns and tracking real-life engagement.
Co-Design Workshop: Collaborated with users to ideate and refine Nimbus, ensuring alignment with real-world needs and preferences.
Focus Group Testing: Evaluated the initial concept, gathering user feedback on its effectiveness, engagement mechanisms, and ethical considerations.`,
        methods: `AI Integration, User Research, Co-Design, User Interviews, Focus Groups`,
        userInsights: `Physical interventions matter – Users emphasized the importance of integrating physical approaches (e.g., turning off devices, locking screens) alongside AI-driven strategies.
Rewards drive motivation – A reward-based system for achieving screen time goals is essential for user engagement and long-term adherence.
Encouragement beyond the screen – AI should actively promote real-life activities, reinforcing positive habits outside digital environments.
Smart activity tracking – AI should primarily function by detecting device usage versus real-life engagement, allowing for adaptive interventions.`,

        overview: `As a UX Researcher and UX Designer for a Bath Professional ( a bathroom refurbishment company), my role involved conducting a comprehensive heuristic evaluation of the company website to identify usability issues before initiating user testing. By applying the established Nielsen Heuristics, I assessed the interface for potential pain points, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement, ensuring that customers could easily explore bathroom renovation services, browse design options, and request quotes. To further validate these findings, I conducted moderated usability tests with key user groups, observing how potential customers navigated the website to find services, pricing, and inspiration. Additionally, I administered the SUPR-Q questionnaire to measure the overall user experience, gathering quantitative insights on usability, trust, and customer satisfaction. These findings provided a data-driven foundation to enhance the website's effectiveness in converting visitors into customers.

Beyond identifying usability challenges, I focused on optimizing the website's information architecture by running card sorting sessions with users. This process helped restructure content categories and navigation, ensuring a seamless browsing experience for users seeking bathroom remodeling solutions. After analyzing the collected data, I synthesized key findings to highlight usability issues and positive interactions, translating insights into actionable design improvements. Applying these insights, I created redesigns aimed at improving the website's usability, visual appeal, and customer conversion capabilities. These redesigns, along with research-backed recommendations, were presented to stakeholders to align business objectives with user needs. Finally, I compiled a detailed usability report outlining key findings, recommendations, and design improvements, providing strategic guidelines for improving the overall user experience of the company's website.

        overview: `As a UX Researcher for 4th Wave Business Solutions (a telecommunications construction company) , I led client interviews to uncover challenges in managing digital infrastructure projects, gathering insights from industry professionals to understand their needs, workflows, pain points, and needs. To visualize these findings, I mapped the end-to-end customer journey, identifying friction across key touchpoints, such as project planning, execution, and ongoing maintenance. To further refine the user experience, I conducted moderated usability testing on the company's website, client portals, and self-service tools, assessing their effectiveness in helping businesses manage infrastructure requests, track project progress, and access critical documentation.

I also improved internal client documentation to ensure clearer infrastructure management resources. Additionally, I conducted a competitive UX analysis to identify industry best practices and opportunities for differentiation. To enhance workflow effectiveness, I evaluated field technicians' internal tools through interviews and questionnaires, uncovering usability challenges that impacted productivity. These insights informed recommendations for tool improvements, ensuring that both clients and employees had seamless digital experiences tailored to their needs.
